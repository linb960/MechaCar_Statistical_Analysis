# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview
A company AutosRUs' is testing a new prototype __MechaCar__.  This prototype is having some production troubles blocking manufacturing.  This analysis will review production data to gain insight to help the production team.

## Setup and Tools
The manufacturing team provided two files to help with the analytics __MechaCar_mpg.csv__ and __Suspension_Coil.csv__.  Using the R programming language and the __dplyr__ library the following will be done: <br>
- A multiple Linear regression will be done to identify which variables predict the mpg of the prototype.
- Summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) will be collected.
- t-tests will be run to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- A statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar against other vehicles will be designed.
